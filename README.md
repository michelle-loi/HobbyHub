## Dependencies
The following packages and dependencies are being used:
1. Vite
2. React BootStrap
3. React Router Dom
4. sass/scss
5. react-responsive

## Getting started
1. cd client
2. npm install
3. Go to the login page if the login button is not purple then the custom bootstrap colors are not working run the
   command:

   `npm add -D sass`

## Customizing Bootstrap 
1. I have set Bootstraps primary to be `#8B45FF` and the font family to Roboto. If you want to change any of bootstraps
   defaults you can under the sass folder there is a main.scss you can add the custom code there. Please be careful
   if you change padding or margins because it could break all bootstrap.
